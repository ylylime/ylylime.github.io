# #include x WiCS Personal Portfolio Workshop ✨

Welcome to our portfolio workshop! We're glad to have you here today. Below is a set of instructions you should read over and make sure you follow to ensure smooth sailing.

## Getting Started

1. `Make sure you have npm`. If not, install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to get access to npm. Check by inputting the following into your terminal:
   
   ```
   npm --version
   ```
2. `Fork the repository` by clicking Fork at the top. This creates your own copy that you can change however you want!
3. Head to Settings and `rename the repository` to:
   
   ```
   <your-username>.github.io
   ```
   - Replace your-username with your GitHub username.
4. `Clone your forked repository`. Get to your desired directory and type into your terminal
   
   ```
   git clone repo_link
   ```
   - Replace **repo_link** with the url you find when pressing the green `<> Code` button in your repository
5. `Navigate into the created folder` and you're all set to code!

## Deploying Your Project

So, now you have a forked repository and can code to your heart's content. But, how are people going to see the beautiful site that you made? This is where deployment comes into play.

- Deployment essentially puts all of your hard work on the web for anyone to see.
- A host provider (in our case GitHub) is needed to keep the site up and they provide you a domain url, which is where people navigate to in order to get to your site.
- **If you want a custom domain url, you will have to buy it online**. For our purposes, we will be using the url that GitHub gives us.
- `If you do not want to deploy, you can skip the next steps`. Though, we highly encourage you to do so :>

## Setting Up GitHub Pages

1. `Click on Settings in your forked repository`.
2. `Find Pages on the left and press it`. You should now see a **Build and deployment** with a **source**.
3. Click on **source** and select `GitHub Actions`.
   - This indicates that your deployment will be done through GitHub Actions.
   - We have setup a GitHub Actions file that handles the deploying already! If you're interested, look into workflows and yaml files.
4. Click on Actions at the top and `agree to enable GitHub Workflows`.
5. `Now, make a change to your code, commit, and push!` You should now see in your GitHub repository a symbol next to your latest commit that shows whether or not the deployment was successful.

## Project Development

As you make changes to your project, you likely want to see them update live. Our frontend framework utilizes Nextjs, so below are the steps to test a Nextjs app.

1. Make sure you're in the right directory with folders like src, public, etc.
2. In your terminal, type `npm i` to **install all the necessary dependencies** for the project.
3. Navigate to ```next.config.mjs``` **edit the basePath** to be your ```repository name```.
   - **We will also need to add this basePath to every image that we intend to use and localhost url. VERY IMPORTANT**
4. Now, you can run the app with `npm run dev` to **launch a development session**, which comes with its own localhost url!
   - Changes automatically refresh the app
   - Any errors will be displayed for you to debug
